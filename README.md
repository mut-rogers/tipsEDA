A simple Exploratory Data Analysis for the Tips Dataset 

# Description 
The "tips" dataset is a popular dataset often used for demonstration and practice in data analysis and visualization. It contains information about various attributes of customers in a restaurant, including the total bill amount, tip amount, gender, whether the customer smokes or not, the day of the week, time of day, and the size of the party. These attributes are related to the dining experience of customers.

#### The dataset contains the following columns;

- total_bill: The total amount of the bill, including tax and any additional charges.
- tip: The amount of tip given by the customer.
- sex: The gender of the person paying the bill (e.g., Male or Female).
- smoker: Whether the party included smokers or non-smokers.
- day: The day of the week when the bill was paid (e.g., Sun, Sat, etc.).
- time: The time of day when the bill was paid (e.g., Lunch or Dinner).
- size: The size of the dining party (number of people).

I will use this dataset to hone my EDA and Data Viz skills
